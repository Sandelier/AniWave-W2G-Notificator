## Installation

### Firefox
You can find the extension for Firefox on Mozilla's add-on page: [AniWave-W2G-Notifications](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/aniwave-w2g-notifications/)

### Chromium
For Chromium browsers like Chrome or brave, you need to download the zip file from [Releases](https://github.com/Sandelier/AniWave-W2G-Notificator/releases) and manually add it to Chromium since Google wants me to pay them if i want it to be published in their own web store.

## Acknowledgements

Development of the project was helped a lot with [Puppeteer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer) and [Puppeteer Extra Plugin Stealth](https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth) due to aniwave using disable-devtool library.
